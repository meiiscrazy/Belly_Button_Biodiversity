# Bellybutton Diversity

Using JavaScript, HTML, and Plotly, I created a local webpage that shows and updates the page when you select a new ID number. The webpage includes a bubble chart, bar graph, and a gauge to show all the data. 

The hardest part of creating the webpage was the gauge meter. While it is informative, it is also unnecessary but a fun challenge.
